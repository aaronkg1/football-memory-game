This is a football memory game I created with the create-react-app.
The aim of the game is to click on all players without clicking on the same player more than once. Each time you click on a player, the order of the players shuffles.

The main purpose for building this app was to learn how to implement useEffect react hooks to control the life cycle of the modules.
